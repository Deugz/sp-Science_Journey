```{epigraph}

This section is aimed at giving a quick introduction of myself. Not a trivial task if one wants to give a general overview of himself while avoiding the slippery slope of the egotrip. I have created a dedicated website, an online temple for myself, that you can visit by clicking on the right card. Here, I will mostly speak about my **Ikigai** (my purpose in life).

## Ikigai

You may have understood it by now but I don't thrive having to fit in a box and this is why I created my own web plateform, to host and make flourish my unique personality and peculiar set of skills. However, I acknowledge the importance to have a framework to organise and build your life and I have choosen the Ikigai method, which can be described as follow:

<p class="emphase"> <strong>Content creator</strong></p>


```{admonition} What type of content does researcher / teacher produced ?
:class: tip, dropdown

Researchers produce a variety of content, scientific articles, power point presentations, talks, reports, grants applications, outreach materials ... Teachers also have to write their own materials, lessons, assesments ... All of those have to obey to certain templates and a specific format which make them hard to digest by the members of the public. 

```

```{admonition} How, where is it shared ?
:class: note, dropdown

- Problem in the way both Research and teaching materials are published, shared and distilled.

```

```{admonition} Who does this content belongs to ?
:class: warning, dropdown

Definitely not the researcher, nor the teacher

```

```{admonition} Today, what is a content creator ?
:class: important, dropdown
