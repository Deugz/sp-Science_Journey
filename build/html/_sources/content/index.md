You have just set foot on my academic websites portefolio, a deep collection of web pages that may look daunting at first glance. Don't worry, everything is well organised and for the moment you are *on the top of the iceberg*. This website is dedicated to explain and link to the different sections (websites) you can visit and what they contain.
