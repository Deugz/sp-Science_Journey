<p class="emphase2"><strong>For me</strong></p>

:::{dropdown} Testing a note taking methodologie fitted for me and modern Science

This website is build using JupyterBook (a distribution of Sphinx). It is a documentation engine 

:::

:::{dropdown} Possibility to build a single ressource over the length of my career

In a capitalist framework, it is better to deliver a multitude of small single outputs than working on a single object. More deliverable, more possibilities to sell. I truly believe this needs to change 

*Just get it done and go to the next one*: This is the mantra of Scientific publishing (at least for a thesis).

:::{dropdown} Making Science accessible, creative and delivered online, for all

Internet is a great tool

:::


:::{dropdown} Taking people onboard to explore the mysterious wonders of this world

As a Scientist, I believe I have great stories to tell, but is scientific writing fitted for that purpose?  

:::

There is multiple layers to the projects (cf project section) but I guess the most important one for me is to deliver cutting-edge science in an accessible format with a creative touch.
