<p class="emphase2"><strong>Aim </strong></p>

<p class="emphase">Using 21st century tools to create and sustain a constructive scientific dialogue</p>

The emergence of the internet unfolded new ways to share and discuss content of all sorts. We now have a rich ecocystem of <span class="hovertext" data-hover="def">Open source</span> projects facilitated by the <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Also called CC">Licence creative common</span> and yet, scientists are still relying on a 17th century old method to share their knowledge (scientific papers). The method evolved for centuries to become one of the most lucrative business as well as a technique enslaving scientists to the publication system (by the use of metrics and their importance in career advancement). This is perverting science. I think it is time to go forward in the way we share our research outputs and create a new system designed for <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Who are we ?">our</span> Open Science needs. 


<br>
<br>


<p class="emphase2"><strong>How </strong></p>

<p class="emphase">By empowering scientists with a single plateform embeding all the necessary tools and methodologies for Open Science </p>

From all the tools mentioned on the right, the one you may be less familiar with is `Jupyter Book`. It is an open software, part of the [Project Jupyter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter), that takes a collection of <span class="hovertext" data-hover="(.ipynb)">jupyter notebooks</span>  and <span class="hovertext" data-hover="(.md)">markdown files</span>, compile them to produce a <span class="hovertext" data-hover="collection of .html file">static web-site</span>. I think I can deliver a proof of concept version of a single<strong> web-plateform </strong>designed to help researcher retake possesion of their work. *I see every piece of research like a furniture item, owing a web-site is like having a home within wich you can implement your furniture and design it according to your taste, and those of your guests.* 



<br>
<br>


<p class="emphase2"><strong>To  </strong></p>

<p class="emphase">Build, publish and share, beautiful publication-quality books and documents, from all your research outputs</p>


- Develop and maintain their research toolbox
- Produce, store, edit and share all their scientific notes, 
- Publish all your Research Outputs 


I think at this point it is best to show you an example: The web-site on the right is a <a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html" target="blank"> Research compendium </a> produced using <a href="https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html" target="blank"> Jupyter-Book</a>. This book is part of the **Science For the People** project whose aim is to empower researcher to self-publish themselves in an open and innovative way, far from the unsustainable current publication system. This Book focus on my PhD project.


<br>
<br>


<p class="emphase2"><strong>For   </strong></p>

<p class="emphase">Providing an alternative to the current publication system</p>

<h5><strong>Target</strong></h5>

- Most usefull for PhD students (use from Start)
- Adaptable to individual needs    

- multiscale
